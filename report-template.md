# Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution
#### RUTH NDUTA

## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
Initially, the submission failed giving an error for the date time data type to be converted to string from datetime.

### What was the top ranked model that performed?
The hyperparameter tuned model performed best. Optimizing the hyperparameters allowed for improvement in the perfomance of the model.

## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?


### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
TODO: Add your explanation

## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
TODO: Add your explanation

### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
TODO: Add your explanation

### Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.
|model|hpo1|hpo2|hpo3|score|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|initial|?|?|?|?|
|add_features|?|?|?|?|
|hpo|?|?|?|?|

### Create a line plot showing the top model score for the three (or more) training runs during the project.
